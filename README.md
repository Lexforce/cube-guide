# Vintage cube guide

Some introductory text

The bangers, first picks and most broken cards:
* Black Lotus
* The moxes
* Sol Ring
* Mana Crypt
* Time Walk
* Ancestral Recall

# General stuff
Fetchlands are great. You can start of a draft picking a couple of fetchlands and feel ok.  
Manabases can be really good if you pick fetchlands / duals / shocklands / triomes highly.  
Starting the draft trying to find one open color is good, like in normal draft.  
Pick cheap cards highly, i.e. most 5-drops are very replacable, 1-2-3 drops are more important to
get first.
