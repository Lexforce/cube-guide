# General stuff
Starting the draft trying to find one open color is good, like in normal draft.  
Pick cheap cards highly, i.e. most 4/5-drops are very replacable, 1-2-3 drops are more important to
get first.  
Fetchlands are great. You can start of a draft picking a couple of fetchlands and feel ok.  
Manabases can be really good if you pick fetchlands / duals / shocklands / triomes highly.  


# Archetypes
There are many archetypes in the cube, this is not comprehensive but an overview.  

## White Wheenie (Mono White)
Aggro deck, with disruptive creatures  
Wants a low curve with 17-18+ creatures and some good removal.  
Great cards:
* [Mother of runes](https://scryfall.com/search?q=mother%20of%20runes)
* [Thalia](https://scryfall.com/search?q=thalia,%20guardian)
* [Parallax Wave](https://scryfall.com/search?q=parallax%20wave)
* [Swords to Plowshares](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Swords%20to%20plow)

## Red aggro (burn)
Aggro deck with lots cheap creatuers and burn / reach instead of disruption.  
Great cards:
* [Lightning bolt](https://scryfall.com/search?q=lightning%20bolt)
* [Ragavan](https://scryfall.com/search?q=ragavan,%20nimble)
* [Fireblast](https://scryfall.com/search?q=fireblast)
* [Sulfuric Vortex](https://scryfall.com/search?q=sulfuric%20vortex)

## Green ramp
Ramp deck / creature deck  
Wants to ramp with cards like [LLanowar Elves](https://scryfall.com/search?q=LLanowar%20elves) into something big like a craterhoof behemoth.  
Craterhoof is a good wincon for thius deck because it so easily wins the game with just a couple of creatures in play.  
Great cards:
* [Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Rofellos,%20llano)
* [Natural Order](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Natural%20Order)
* [Green Sun's Zenith](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Green%20sun's%20z)
* [Craterhoof Behemoth](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Craterhoof%20beh)
* [Channel](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!channel), can be insane with a big eldrazi

## Reanimator Black (can be BR, UB or other variations)
Wants to reanimate a huge threat early in the game, supported by discard and good removal.  
Great cards:
* [Entomb](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Entomb), unique in the archetype since it both tutors and discards a threat
* [Reanimate](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Reanimate), [Animate Dead](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Animate%20Dead) (the best 2 reanimate spells)
* [Archon of Cruelty](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Archon%20of%20Crue), [Griselbrand](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Griselbrand), archon is best in my book
* [Thoughtseize](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Thoughtseize)

## Artifacts (ususally heavy blue)
Abuse artifact synergy cards, ramp a lot!
[Tinker](https://scryfall.com/search?q=tinker) can be very nuts with a good target like [Blightsteel Colossus](https://scryfall.com/search?q=blightsteel%20colossus)  
Can be sick to have [Balance](https://scryfall.com/search?q=balance), if you have a lot of artifact mana.  
Great cards:
* [Tolarian Academy](https://scryfall.com/search?q=tolarian%20academy)
* [Tinker](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!tinker)
* [Urza, Lord High Artificier](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Urza,%20lord%20high)

## Control (U + anything but G usually)
Counter stuff and delay your opponent, drop big threats or combo in the lategame.  
Usually heavy on good counters and cantrips / removal.  
Great cards:
* [Fractured Identity](https://scryfall.com/search?q=fractured%20identity)
* [Counterspell](https://scryfall.com/search?q=counterspell)
* [Bribery](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Bribery) (in some matchups)

## Storm (Can be all colors except white usually)
Combo with lots of mana generation, card draw and a storm finisher.  
Can be hard to put together.  
Great cards:
* [Brain Freeze](https://scryfall.com/search?q=brain%20freeze), the best storm card IMO
* [High tide](https://scryfall.com/search?q=high%20tide), with untap effects it generates a million mana
* [Time Spiral](https://scryfall.com/search?q=time%20Spiral)

# Card combos
A non-complete list of combos  
## Twin combo
A classic cube-combo.  
Use [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/search?q=Splinter%20Twin)/[Kiki-Jiki](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!"kiki-jiki,%20mirror%20breaker") with [Deceiver Exarch](https://scryfall.com/search?q=deceiver%20exarch) / [Pestermite](https://scryfall.com/search?q=!pestermite) to generate infinite hasty creatures.
